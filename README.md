## About ##
This project provides an API to connect to Remote Play hosts (PS4, PS5). It is not intended to be completely usable and is missing features such as real-time video streaming, although these features may be added in the future. This library is heavily based on the C/C++ project [Chiaki](https://github.com/thestr4ng3r/chiaki).
